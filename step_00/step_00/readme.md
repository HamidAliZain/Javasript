# Connectivity

There are several ways to connect HTML and JavaScript. Here are the main methods:

## Inline JavaScript

You can include JavaScript code directly within your HTML file using the script tag.

```html
<script>
  // Your JavaScript code here
</script>
```

## External JavaScript File

You can also store your JavaScript code in a separate file (e.g., script.js) and link it to your HTML file using the script tag.

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
