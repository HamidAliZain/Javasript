# Data Types

JavaScript has several data types:

## Numbers

Integer or floating-point numbers.

```javascript
var count = 10;
var price = 19.99;
```

## Strings

Sequence of characters enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

```javascript
var greeting = "Hello";
var fullName = "John Doe";
```

## Booleans

Represents either true or false.

```javascript
var isRaining = true;
var isLoggedIn = false;
```

## Undefined

The default value of a variable that has been declared but not initialized.

```javascript
var undefinedVar;
```

## Null

Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

```javascript
var nullValue = null;
```

## Symbols

Uniquely identifiable primitive value often used for object property keys.

```javascript
var uniqueKey = Symbol("uniqueKey");
```

## BigInt

Represents whole numbers larger than the maximum safe integer.

```javascript
var bigNumber = BigInt(9007199254740991);
```

## Objects

Objects are a fundamental reference type in JavaScript. They represent a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings or symbols, and values can be of any data type, including other objects.

```javascript
var person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
```

## Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists that can hold values of any data type. Each element in an array has an index, starting from 0.

```javascript
var multipleData = [1, "my name is Hamid", true, { name: "John", age: 25 }];
```
