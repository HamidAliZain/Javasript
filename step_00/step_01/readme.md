# Variables

Think of a variable as a container or a box that can hold different types of information. You give a name to the box, and then you can put things in it or take things out of it.

## Example

Imagine you have a box named age. You can put a number in it, like your age:

```javascript
var age = 25;
```

Now, the box age contains the value 25. You can later change the value in the box:

```javascript
var age = 28;
```

Now, the box age contains the value 28.
